## STUDY AREA
Kancheepuram is one of the states of Tamil Nadu’s 38 districts. The area that is presently part of the Kancheepuram district was formerly part of the Chengalpattu district. The Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur district was formed in 1997 by dividing the previous Chengalpattu district. Its latitude and longitude are 12° 14′ 00′′ to 13° 02′ 00′′ N and 79° 31′ 30′′ to 80° 15′ 30′′ E, respectively. The district covers a total area of 4,43,210 hectares.

## MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PALAR RIVER BASIN
Morphometric parameters	Formula & definition	Reference
Area of basin (A)	Plan area of the watershed (km^2)	Horton 1945
Bifurcation ratio (Rb)	Rb = Nu / Nu + 1 
Where Nu = number of stream segments present in the given order
Nu + 1 = number of segments of the next higher order	Schumn 1956
Stream density (Dd)	Dd = Stream length/Basin area	Horton 1945
Circulatory ratio (Rc)	 Rc = 4 π × A / P2
Where A = area of the basin
π = 3.14
P = perimeter of the basin
	Miller 1953
Compactness Coefficient (Cc)	Cc = 0.2821P/A^0.5
Where P = basin perimeter
A = area of the basin	Gravelius 1914
Constant channel maintenance 
(C)	Lof = 1/ Dd
Where Dd = drainage density	Horton 1945
Drainage density (Dd)	Dd = L/A 
where L = total length of stream
A = area of the basin	Horton 1945
Elongation ration (Re)	Re =√ (A/ π)/Lb
Where A = area of basin
π = 3.14
Lb = basin length	Schumn 1956
Form factor (Ff)	Ff = A/(Lb)2
Where A = area of basin
Lb = basin length	Horton 1945
Length of overland flow (Lg)	Lg = 1/2Dd 
Where Dd = drainage density	Horton 1945
Length Area Relation (Lar)	Lar = 1.4*A0.6	Hack 1957
Mean stream length (Lsm)	Lsm = Lu/Nu 
Where Lu = mean stream length of a given order (km)
Nu = number of stream segments	Horton 1945
Perimeter of basin (P)	Perimeter of watershed (km)	Horton 1945
Stream frequency (Fs)	Fs = N/A 
Where L = total number of streams
A = area of basin	Horton 1945
Stream length (LU)	Length of the stream	Horton 1945
Stream number (Nu)	Nu = Total number of stream segments of order u	Strahler 1964
Stream order (U)	Hierarchical order	Strahler 1964
Texture ratio (T)	T = N1/P where N1 = total number of first order-stream
P = perimeter of basin
	Horton 1945
## RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The findings of the examination of the morphometric characteristics of the Palar River Basin are shown below. The research area is 1904.43 km^2 in size. The overall geography of the area causes the dendritic drainage pattern, which is sloped.
